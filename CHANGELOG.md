## [v0.3.0] ‚Äî 2024-09-23

### ‚ö° Improvements

*   Designed experimental distribution [metadata schema] to be appended to v2
    `META.json` by PGXN upon release. The object is in [JWS-JS] format, and
    intended to sign the release user, date, URI, and one or more SHA digests
    for the distribution zip file. The format is subject to change pending
    expert review and approval of the [JWS-signing RFC].
*   Created release JSON Schemas for [v1] and [v2] release validation. PGXN
    Manager adds the v1 metadata to the distribution-supplied `META.json` so
    that clients can validate downloads. In the future it will generate the v2
    JWS-signed schema.
*   Added the [release module], which extends the [dist module] to load loads
    v1 and v2 spec files into read-only data structures, converts v1 metadata
    to v2, and merges multiple files.

### üìî Notes

*   Renamed the meta module to the [dist module], since it handles
    *distribution* metadata, and therefore better compliments the new [release
    module], which handles *release* metadata.
*   Removed the SHA-256 hash from the [v2 artifacts schema], leaving only
    SHA-512.
*   Replaced the `TryFrom<PathBuf>` trait in the [dist module] with a `load`
    function. This is because one does not convert a file path into a struct,
    but loads it into a struct. It also allows the argument to be of type
    `AsRef<Path>`, which supports `Path`, `PathBuf`, or `String` arguments.
*   The v1-v2 conversion in the [release module] does not sign the release
    payload, as we are not doing any key signing, yet. For now it generates
    random strings to satisfy JSON Schema validation.

## [v0.2.0] ‚Äî 2024-09-12

### ‚ö° Improvements

*   Added the [meta module], which loads v1 and v2 spec files into read-only
    data structures, converts v1 metadata to v2, and merges multiple files.

### ü™≤ Bug Fixes

*   Changed the v1 validator to allow `http` as well as `https` in the
    `meta-spec` object's `url` field, as a lot of older `META.json` files use
    it.

### üìî Notes

*   Moved the validation functionality to the [valid module].

### üìö Documentation

*   Updated the `v2` link in all docs to point to the [pull request], since it
    hasn't been merged and published yet.
*   Updated the README example to use the [meta module] to load an object.
