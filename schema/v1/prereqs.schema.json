  "description": "This field describes all the prerequisites of the distribution. The keys are phases of activity, such as `configure`, `build`, `test`, and `runtime`. Values are objects in which the keys name the type of prerequisite relationship such as `requires`, `recommends`, `suggests`, or `conflicts`, and the values provide sets of prerequisite relations. The sets of relations **must** be specified as objects mapping extension names to version ranges.\n\nThe prereq spec structure divides prerequisites into *Phases* of activity in the installation process and *Relationships* that indicate how prerequisites should be resolved.\n\nNote that the `prereqs` key may not be used to specify prerequisites distributed outside PGXN or the PostgreSQL core and its contrib extensions.\n\nRequirements for regular use must be listed in the `runtime` phase. Other requirements should be listed in the earliest stage in which they are required and consumers must accumulate and satisfy requirements across phases before executing the activity. For example, `build` requirements must also be available during the `test` phase.",
