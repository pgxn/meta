# RFC TBD
# PostgreSQL Extension Network Distribution Metadata Specification

## Abstract ##

This document describes version 2.0.0 of the PGXN source distribution metadata
specification, also known as the "PGXN Meta Spec." PGXN Metadata ships with
PostgreSQL extension source distribution archives, and serves to describe the
their contents for the benefit of automated indexing, distribution, full-text
search, binary packaging, and more.

## Status of This Memo ##

This is a Standards Track document.

This RFC represents the consensus of the distributed community of PostgreSQL
extension developers, distributors, and packagers, generally referred to as
the "PostgreSQL Extension Ecosystem". It is formatted using the [Github
Flavored Markdown] variant of [Markdown], and the canonical copy will always
be found at [master.pgxn.org/meta/spec.txt]. A generated HTML-formatted copy
found at [pgxn.org/spec/] **MAY** also be considered canonical.

Information about the current status of this document, any errata, and how to
provide feedback on it **MAY** be obtained from its [source code repository].

License].

## Introduction ##

Distribution metadata describe important properties of PGXN source code
distributions. Tools that build PGXN source distribution archives **SHOULD**
create a metadata file in accordance with this specification and include it
with the distribution for use by automated tools that index, examine, package,
or install PGXN source distributions.

### Terminology ###

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119].

This document makes use of the following additional terms:

#### Package ####

A collection of extensions that are released, versioned, and distributed
together. Packages **MAY** be downloaded directly from version control
repositories or in [archive files] generated by a release tag.

#### Source Distribution ####

An archive of the source code for the release of a Package, together with
metadata defined by this spec, distributed for other developers to build,
install, and use. The file name of a Source Distribution consists of the
package name, a dash, and the version, e.g., `pgtap-1.14.3.zip`.

#### Extension ####

A software component that extends the capabilities of a PostgreSQL database or
cluster. Extensions **MAY** be `CREATE EXTENSION` [extensions], [background
workers], command-line apps, [loadable modules], shared libraries, and more.

#### Consumer ####

Code that reads a metadata file, deserializes it into a data structure in
memory, or interprets a data structure of metadata elements.

#### Producer ####

Code that constructs a metadata data structure, serializes it into a byte
stream, and/or writes it to disk.

### Data Types ###

Properties in the [Structure](#structure) section describe data elements, each
of which has an associated data type as described herein. Each is based on the
primitive types defined by [JSON]: *object*, *array*, *string*, *number*, and
*boolean*. Other types are subtypes of these primitives and define compound
data structures or define constraints on the values of a data element.

#### Boolean ####

A *Boolean* is used to provide a true or false value. It **MUST** be
represented as a defined (not `null`) value.

#### String ####

A *String* is data element containing a non-zero length sequence of Unicode
characters.

#### Array ####

An *Array* is an ordered collection of one or more data elements. Items in an
Array **MAY** be of mixed types.

#### Object ####

An *Object* is an unordered collection of zero or more data elements
("values"), indexed by associated [String](#string) elements ("keys"). An
Object's values **MAY** be of mixed types.

#### Term ####

A *Term* is a [String](#string) that **MUST** be at least two characters long,
and contain no slash (`/`), backslash (`\`), control, or space characters.

#### Tag ####

A *Tag* is a [String](#string) that **MUST** be at least two and no more than
255 characters long, and contain no slash (`/`), backslash (`\`), or control
characters.

#### URI ####

*URI* is a [String](#string) containing a valid Uniform Resource Identifier or
Locator as defined by [IETF RFC 3986].

#### Path ####

*Path* is a [String](#string) with a relative file path that identifies a file
in the distribution. The path **MUST** be specified with unix conventions.

#### Version ####

A *Version* is a [String](#string) containing a value that describes the
version number of extensions or distributions, and adhere to the format of the
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Specification][semver] with the exception of [Build
metadata], which is reserved for use by downstream packaging systems.

#### Version Range ####

A *Version Range* is a [String](#string) that describes a range of Versions
that **MAY** be present or installed to fulfill dependencies.

The simplest format for a Version Range is just the version number itself,
e.g. `2.4.2`. This means that **at least** version 2.4.2 must be present.
Versions may also be truncated to their major or minor parts, as appropriate.
For example, `2.4` means that **at least** version 2.4.0 must be present.

To indicate that **any** version is okay, use the version `0`.

Alternatively, a version range **may** use the operators `<` (less than), `<=`
(less than or equal), `>` (greater than), `>=` (greater than or equal), `==`
(equal), and `!=` (not equal). For example, the specification `< 2` means that
any version of the dependency less than version 2 is suitable.

For more complicated situations, version specifications **may** be AND-ed
together using commas. The specification `>= 1.2, != 1.5.2, < 2.0`
indicates a version that must be **at least** 1.2, **less than** 2.0, and
**not equal to** 1.5.2.

#### License String ####

A *License String* is a [String](#string) with a restricted set of values.
Valid values are defined by the [SPDX License].

#### License Expression ####

A *License Expression* is a [String](#string) that represents one or more
licenses under which the contents of the package are distributed by combining
License Strings into a single value. The format is defined by the [SPDX
Standard License Expression].

#### purl ####

A [String](#string) containing a valid package URL defined by the [purl spec].
All known [purl Types] **MAY** be used, as well as `pgxn` for PGXN packages
and `postgres` for PostgreSQL core [contrib] or development packages.

#### Platform ####

A [Platform] specification is a [String](#string) that identifies a supported
platform with one to three dash-delimited substrings: An OS name, the OS
version, and the architecture: `$os-$version-$architecture`.

If the string contains no dash, it represents only the OS. If it contains a
single dash, the values represent the OS and the architecture. The complete
list of values will be determined by the [bulid farm animals]. Some likely
Examples:

*   `linux`: Any Linux
*   `linux-x86_64`: Any Linux on x86_64
*   `gnulinux-x86_64`: [GNU] Linux on x86_64
*   `musllinux-1.2-aarch64`: [musl] Linux v1.2 on aarch64
*   `darwin`: Any Darwin (macOS)
*   `darwin-23.5.0-aarch64`: Darwin (macOS) 23.5.0 on aarch64

## Structure

The metadata structure is an [Object](#object). This section describes valid
properties of the [Object](#object).

Any properties not described in this specification document (whether top-level
or within compound data structures described herein) are considered *custom
properties* and **MUST** begin with an "x" or "X" and be followed by an
underscore; i.e., they **MUST** match the regular expression pattern
`^[xX]_.`. If a custom property refers to a compound data structure,
properties within it do not need an "x_" or "X_" prefix.

[Consumers](#consumer) of metadata **MAY** ignore any or all custom
properties. All other properties not described herein are invalid and
**SHOULD** be ignored by [Consumers](#consumer). [Producers](#producer) **MUST
NOT** generate or output invalid properties.

For each property, one or more examples are provided followed by a
description. The description begins with the version of spec in which the
property was added or in which the definition was modified, whether the
property is **REQUIRED** or **OPTIONAL**, and the data type of the
corresponding value. These items are in parentheses, brackets, and braces,
respectively.

If a data type is an [Object](#object), valid sub-properties will be described
as well.

All examples are represented as [JSON].

<!-- Nothing deprecated yet.
Some properties are marked *Deprecated*. These are shown for historical
context and **MUST NOT** be produced in or consumed from any metadata structure of
version 2 or higher.
-->

#### meta-spec ####

``` json
"meta-spec": {
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "url": "https://pgxn.org/meta/v2/spec.txt"
}
```

(Spec 1) [required] {[Map](#Map)}

This field indicates the [Version](#Version) of the PGXN Meta Spec that
**SHOULD** be used to interpret the metadata. Consumers **MUST** check this
key as soon as possible and abort further metadata processing if the meta-spec
[Version](#version) is not supported by the consumer.

The following properties are valid, but only `version` is **REQUIRED**.

*   **version**: The [Version](#version) of the PGXN Meta Spec against which
    the metadata object was generated.

*   **url**: The [URI](#uri) of the metadata specification corresponding to
    the given version. This is strictly for human-consumption and **SHOULD
    NOT** impact the interpretation of the metadata structure.

#### name ####

Example:

``` json
"name": "pgTAP"
```

(Spec 1) [required] {[Term](#Term)}

This property is the name of the package. This is usually the same as the name
of the "main extension" in the distribution, but **MAY** be completely
unrelated to the extensions within the distribution. This value will be used
in the distribution file name on PGXN.

#### version ####

``` json
"version": "1.3.6"
```

(Spec 1) [required] {[Version](#version)}

This property gives the version of the distribution to which the metadata
structure refers. Its value **MUST** be a [Version](#version).

All of the items listed in [contents](#contents) will be considered to have
this version; any references they make to a version, such as the [control
file], **SHOULD** be compatible with this version.

### Optional Fields ###

#### description ####

``` json
"description": "pgTAP is a suite of database functions that make it easy to write TAP-emitting unit tests in psql scripts or xUnit-style test functions."
```

(Spec 1) [optional] {[String](#string)}

A longer, more complete description of the purpose or intended use of the
distribution, answering the question "what is this thing and what value is
it?"

#### generated_by ####

Example:

``` json
"generated_by": "Module::Build::PGXN version 0.42"
```

(Spec 1) [optional] {[String](#string)}

This property indicates the tool that was used to create this metadata. There
are no defined semantics for this property, but it is traditional to use a
string in the form "Software package version 1.23", or the maintainer's name
if the metadata was generated by hand.

#### classification ####

``` json
{
  "tags": [
    "testing",
    "pair",
    "parameter"
  ],
  "categories": [
    "Machine Learning"
  ]
}
```

(Spec 2) [optional] {[Object](#object) of [Arrays](#array) of [Tags](#tag)}

Classification metadata  associates additional information to improve
discovery. This object **MUST** contain at least one of the following
properties:

*   **tags**: An [Array](#array) of one or more keyword [Tags](#tag)s that
    describe the distribution.
*   **categories**: An [Array](#array) of at least one and no more than three
    of the following [Strings](#string) that categorize the distribution:
    *   Analytics
    *   Auditing and Logging
    *   Change Data Capture
    *   Connectors
    *   Data and Transformations
    *   Debugging
    *   Index and Table Optimizations
    *   Machine Learning
    *   Metrics
    *   Orchestration
    *   Procedural Languages
    *   Query Optimizations

  "*.html"
]
```

(Spec 2) [optional] {[Array](#Array) of [Strings](#string)}

This [Array](#array) describes any files or directories that are private to
the packaging or implementation of the distribution and **SHOULD** be ignored
by indexing or search tools. Values are [Strings](#string) based on a subset
of the [gitignore format].

#### dependencies ####

``` json
"dependencies": {
  "postgres": {
    "version": "14"

(Spec 2) [optional] {[Object](#object)}

This property identifies dependencies required to configure, build, test,
install, and run the extensions in the distribution, expressed as
[purls](#purl). These include not only other extensions, but also external
libraries, system dependencies and the versions of PostgreSQL required, as
well as any OS and version dependencies and architectures ([arm64], [amd64],
etc.).

[Consumers](#consumer) **SHOULD** use this data to determine what dependencies
to install.

Properties:

*   **platforms**: An [Array](#array) of one or more [Platform](#platform)
    strings that identify OSes and architectures supported by the
    distribution. If this property is not present, [Consumers](#consumer)
    **SHOULD** assume that the distribution supports any platform that
    PostgreSQL supports. Typically only needed when the distribution depends
    on platform-specific features.

*   **postgres**: An [Object](#object) describing the versions of PostgreSQL
    required by the package. The object supports the following keys:
    *   **version**: A [Version Range](#version-range) identifying the
        supported versions of PostgreSQL. **REQUIRED**.
    *   **with**: An [Array](#array) of [Terms](#term) that correspond
        features that are required to be compiled into PostgreSQL. Each

information to determine the best option for installing an extension on a
particular system. Useful for projects that publish their own binaries in
GitHu releases and the like.

The [Array](#array) **MUST** have at least one [Object](#object). The
properties of each [Object](#object) are:

*   **url**: A [URI](#uri) to download the artifact. **REQUIRED**.

    describing the artifact, such as none of `binary`, `source`, `rpm`,
    `homebrew`, etc. **REQUIRED**.
*   **platform**: A [Platform](#platform) string identifying the platform the
    artifact was built for. **RECOMMENDED** for packages compiled for a
    specific platform, such as a C extension compiled for `linux-x86_64`.

Each URL **MUST** properly resolve and the checksum **MUST** match.

Dependencies
============

Packages Spec
-------------

The `packages` sub-property of the `dependencies` property defines the
relationship between a distribution and external dependencies, including other
extension packages, system packages, and third-party packages, expressed as
[purls](#purl). The structure is a hierarchical data structure which divides
package dependencies into *Phases* of activity in the installation process and
*Relationships* that indicate how dependencies **SHOULD** be resolved.

For example, to specify that the PGXN extension `pgtap` by user `theory` is
required during the `test` phase, this entry would appear in the distribution
metadata:

``` json
"packages": {
  "test": {
    "requires": [ "pkg:pgxn/theory/pgtap" ]
  }
}
```

All known [purl Types] **MAY** be used to identify dependencies and specific
versions. [Producers](#producer) **SHOULD** specify dependencies of two
additional types as appropriate:

*   **`pkg:pgxn`**: Packages distributed via [PGXN]. These **MUST** include
    both the username and package name, e.g., `pkg:pgxn/theory/pair`.
*   **`pkg:postgres`**: Dependencies distributed as part of the PostgreSQL
    core, including [contrib] or development packages such as [auto_explain],
    [dblink], [pg_regress] and [pg_isolation_regress]. Example:
    `pkg:postgres/dblink`.

[Producers](#producer) **SHOULD** avoid OS-specific [purls](#purl) such as
`pkg:rpm:/libreadline-dev` unless the package supports only OSes that
provide such packages. (See the next item, "variations", for
platform-specific dependency specification.)

[Consumers](#consumer) **SHOULD** use [Repology] to resolve `pkg:generic`
[purls](#purl) to packages specific to the platform on which an extension is
being built. This is useful for specifying system dependencies that vary by
name and packaging system. Otherwise, they **MAY** use whatever techniques or
heuristics are appropriate to install dependencies.

### Phases ###

Requirements for regular use **MUST** be listed in the `runtime` phase. Other
requirements **SHOULD** be listed in the earliest stage in which they are
required, and [Consumers](#consumer) **MUST** accumulate and satisfy
requirements across phases before executing the action. For example, `build`
requirements **MUST** also be available during the `test` phase.

  before action | requirements that **MUST** be met
----------------|-----------------------------------
  ./configure   | configure
  make          | configure, runtime, build
  make test     | configure, runtime, build, test

Consumers that install the distribution **MUST** ensure that *runtime*
requirements are also installed and **MAY** install dependencies from other
phases.

  after action  | requirements that **MUST** be met
----------------|-----------------------------------
  make install  | runtime

*   **configure**: The configure phase occurs before any dynamic configuration
    has been attempted. Dependencies required by the configure phase **MUST**
    be available for use before the distribution building tool has been
    executed.

*   **build**: The build phase is when the distribution's source code is
    compiled (if necessary) and otherwise made ready for installation.

*   **test**: The test phase is when the distribution's automated test suite
    is run. Any dependency needed only for testing and not for subsequent use
    **SHOULD** be listed here.

*   **runtime**: The runtime phase refers not only to when the distribution's
    contents are installed, but also to its continued use. Any package that is
    a dependency for regular use of this distribution **SHOULD** be indicated
    here.

*   **develop**: The develop phase's packages are dependency needed to work on
    the distribution's source code as its maintainer does. These tools might
    be needed to build a release archive, to run maintainer-only tests, or to
    perform other tasks related to developing new versions of the
    distribution.

### Relationships ###

*   **requires**: These dependencies **MUST** be installed for proper
    completion of the phase.

*   **recommends**: **RECOMMENDED** dependencies are *strongly* encouraged and
    **SHOULD** be satisfied except in resource constrained environments.

*   **suggests**: These dependencies are **OPTIONAL**, are suggested for
    enhanced operation of the described distribution, and **MAY** be
    satisfied.

*   **conflicts**: These dependencies **MUST NOT** be installed when the phase
    is in operation. This is a very rare situation, and the conflicts
    relationship **SHOULD** be used with great caution, or not at all.

Serialization
=============

Distribution metadata **SHOULD** be serialized as JSON-encoded data and
packaged with distributions as the file `META.json`.
